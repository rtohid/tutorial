    "Phyfleaux is a transformation framework for [Phylanx](https://github.com/stellar-group/phylanx) *task-graph*. Nodes of the graph are *tasks*, i.e., identified Python functions. builds the task-graph from the Phylanx expression-tree (PhySL). *Task* is   order to improve (minimize) the execution time, Phyfleaux transforms s (a.k.a., PhySL) into task-graphs. . application program run as a set of *tasks* on one or more execution environment(s) which we call *context*. A context consists of a task-graph, target architecture(s) (MIMD, SIMD, SIMT, ...), and also one or more runtime systems (interpreters, executors) running the expressions on target architecture(s).\n",

    "In short, Phyfleaux:\n",

    "1. generates task-graph \n",
    "   - generate the expression-tree (PhySL) \n",
    "   - merging expression-trees of Python functions\n",

    "2. allocates subexpressions to available architecture(s)\n",
    "   - Minimizing application's execution time by maximizing throughputs of its (Python) functions.\n",

    "3. generates executable(s), JIT, for context's runtime\n",
